 My computer experience so far includes the required computer science classes at New Paltz as well as my own interests. I have explored Linux operating systems such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and android programming with Java. I can run apache on Linux with a standard computer or Raspberry PI. I have experience with MATLAB and Octave as well as knowledge of Numeric methods and Linear Algebra. I took Database systems which jumpstarted my exploration into back end Web Development with mySQL, as well as the Web Programming offered in 2015. I‘ve been keeping my HTML, javascript, and CSS skills sharp. I also can work with CGI scripts. I also have a basic working knowledge of C#, Python,  and MongoDB. I also have experience with ARCGIS mapping software.
This semester I am taking Web Programming, Design for the Web, Projects, Statistics, and Discrete and continuous computer algorithms. This semester I want to focus heavily on We Development. I know that I wll gain a lot of new tools within the Web Programming class that will give me tools to create functioning apps. My design for the Web class will be where I can learn tools for front end developmemnt that will further increase my abilites to suceed. I can forsee a lot of useful overlap within these two classes. I want to use the knowledge I learn in this class to create new, functional web applications that are also visually appealing and rich in functionality. I know that the skills I learn in here will also help with my current internship at One Epic Place where I will be working on their membership application/database. I can also definitley use these skills to improve my homepage on the wyvern server found here: http://cs.newpaltz.edu/~clossj1/aboutme/index.html
Its pretty basic so far, but with more time I know it will become something sucessful. I want to use the tools I learn in here to make apps that appeal more to the senses and are more conveinent than existing sites. I‘ve been experimenting with image dropdowns and how images are presented on the screen. Working out useful strategies and combinations of teqniques that produce appealing and efficient results are what I want to learn. I also know I will be brushing up on JavaScript and Web Frameworks, which is something that will help me immensley.
